1.	Which is faster: x * x or std::pow(x,2)?
	Both x*x and std::pow(x, 2) are equally as fast at compile time however x*x is more concise.

2.	Which is faster std::sqrt(x) or std::pow(x, 0.5)?
	std::sqrt(x) is 10 times faster than std::pow(x, 0.5)

3.	What is the fastest way to compute the hypotenuse?
	hypot(x, y) from math.h

4.	What is the fastest way to compute xy?
	x * y probably

5.	What is the best way to approximate (x â€“ 1)!, where x is arbitrary?  Hint: It does not involve a loop of recursive function, and is in cmath.
	scalbn(n - 1)
